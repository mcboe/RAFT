# Due to the linearization of the quadratic drag term in RAFT, the QTFs depend on the sea state specified in the input file.
# If more than one case is analyzed, the outputs are numbered sequentially.
# Two output files are generated:
# - The QTF, following WAMIT .12d file format. File name is qtf-slender_body-total_Head#p##_Case#_WT#.12d
# - The RAOs used to computed the QTFs, following WAMIT .4 file format. File name is qtf-slender_body-total_Head#p##_Case#_WT#.12d
# The Head#p## in the file name indicates the wave heading in degrees (p replaces the decimal point). 
# Case number starts at 1, but turbine at 0 in conformity with the rest of the code.
